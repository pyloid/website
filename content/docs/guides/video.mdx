Pyloid is based on Qt WebEngine, which **only supports open-source codecs**. This is a policy to avoid patent issues, so proprietary codecs like MP4/H.264 are not supported.

When you need to play videos in your web application, you must use videos encoded with open-source codecs.

## Supported Video Codecs

The open-source video codecs supported by Pyloid (Qt WebEngine) are:

- **VP8** - Used in WebM containers
- **VP9** - Used in WebM containers (improved compression over VP8)
- **WebM** - Container format using VP8 or VP9 codecs

## Unsupported Video Codecs

The following codecs are **not supported** due to patent issues:

- **MP4/H.264** - The most widely used codec but protected by patents
- **H.265/HEVC** - Successor to H.264
- Other proprietary codecs

## Basic Usage

You can play WebM format videos using the HTML5 `<video>` tag:

```html
<video
    src="https://dl11.webmfiles.org/big-buck-bunny_trailer-.webm"
    controls
    width="640"
    height="360">
</video>
```

## Using Local Video Files

When playing locally stored WebM files:

```html
<video controls width="640" height="360">
    <source src="/videos/my-video.webm" type="video/webm">
</video>
```


## Important Notes

- **MP4/H.264 files will not play** in Pyloid applications.
- Videos must be converted to WebM format before use.
- Large video files can increase your application's distribution size, so appropriate compression is necessary.
- If loading videos from external URLs, check CORS policies.
